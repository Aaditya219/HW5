        <h2>Welcome to my webpage </h2>
        <p> I am a guy from India who is in his 3rd year of college at UMass Lowell. I major in Computer Science.
               My interests mostly lie in traveling, video games and music. My favorite place to travel to
               is Montreal, Quebec since it's only a 5 hour road trip and it's very beautiful.
               I one day aspire to become a programmer for one of my many favorite video game companies
               (<a href = "https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/">Ubisoft</a>
               , <a href = "https://www.rockstargames.com/">Rockstar Games</a> &
               <a href = "https://rocksteadyltd.com/">Rocksteady Studios</a>
                  are a few that come to mind). There are 2 computer science concentrations that I'm really interested in.
                  They are: <b>Machine Learning</b> and <b>Artificial Intelligence</b>. That is me on the left :-)
